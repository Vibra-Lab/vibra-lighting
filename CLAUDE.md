# vibra-lighting

The Vibra lighting show: the fixture definitions, the QLC+ workspaces, and
the tests that prove the pinned `qlctool` release (https://github.com/spectalive/qlctool),
which generates the whole show and the console it is run from, still builds it.

The onboarding map - environment, the verified regeneration recipe, the traps
and the blast radius - is [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md); the human overview is
[README.md](README.md). This file carries the engineering rules.

## A malfunction is not fixed until a check can see it

This show ran on luck for months. A colour was wrong, somebody nudged it, and
nobody could say whether the next workspace would be right - "a veces
acertamos" (owner, 2026-08-26). Every one of those failures turned out to be a
rule nobody had written down, so writing them down is the work:

1. **Find the cause, not the symptom.** "The beams are dark" is a symptom. "A
   generator that reasons in red, green and blue says nothing at all to a
   fixture whose colour is a wheel" is a cause, and it predicts the next four
   bugs.
2. **Add a rule to `qlctool check`** (`qlctool/checks/` in spectalive/qlctool)
   that sees the cause. A rule reasons about capabilities and the function
   graph - never about a function's name.
3. **Add a regression test to `tests/test_check.py`** in spectalive/qlctool
   that puts the bug back into a generated show and asserts the checker bites.
   Date it and say which night it came from.
4. **Run it over every workspace this repo ships**: the toolkit's gate test
   covers its frozen rig copy, and `tests/vibra_compare.py` here runs every
   rule over the three regenerated workspaces.
   A rule that is only true of one file is not a rule.
5. Only then fix the generator, tag a toolkit release, bump the tag here in
   `requirements.txt`, and regenerate.

`qlctool check <workspace>` is the command. It is a different question from
`qlctool validate`, which only asks whether QLC+ can load the file.

## Before finishing

From the repository root:

```bash
.venv/bin/python -m pytest -q                 # the show's tests against the pinned toolkit
.venv/bin/python tests/vibra_compare.py --validate
.venv/bin/qlctool check "QLC+ Setups/Vibra-split.qxw"
```

Regenerating a show means regenerating all three (`Vibra.qxw`,
`Vibra-beats.qxw`, `Vibra-split.qxw`) and validating each with `--validate`,
which loads it in headless QLC+.

## The backlog

`TODO.md` in this repo, not `~/p/TODO.md` — it moved here on 2026-08-26. Read
it at the start and end of related work; closed items go to `TODO_LOG.md` in
this repo with the date and the evidence, then out of the backlog. That log
moved here from `~/p/TODO_LOG.md` on 2026-09-22, history and all.

## QLC+'s own source is at `~/p/qlcplus`

A clone of upstream QLC+ (`master`, the QLC+ 5 line the show runs). When a
question is about what QLC+ actually does - which XML tags an engine loads,
how a chaser times its steps, what the 3D view can and cannot render, what an
RGBMatrix blend mode really is - **read that clone**, not the web and not
`strings` over the installed binary. `engine/src/` is the engine,
`qmlui/` is the QLC+ 5 UI and 3D preview, `resources/rgbscripts/` the matrix
algorithms.

## What lives where

- `QLC+ Setups/` - the workspaces. `Vibra-split.qxw` carries the current patch.
- `QLC+ Fixtures/` - fixture definitions, verified against the manuals.
- `docs/` - the public findings: the rig, how the show is operated. The file
  format, the checks and the toolkit are documented in spectalive/qlctool.
- `tests/` - the show's tests: the pinned toolkit still generates the three
  Vibra workspaces byte for byte, and the shipped map, profile, definitions and
  pad palette match it.
- the toolkit, installed from `spectalive/qlctool` (pinned in
  `requirements.txt`) into the repo-root `.venv`.
- `TODO.md` - what is still open, and what is blocked on somebody watching the
  rig.

The private context - the show machine, its access, and the decisions behind
the work - is in `~/p/wiki/brain/projects/vibra-dmx.md`.
